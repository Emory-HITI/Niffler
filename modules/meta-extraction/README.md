# The Niffler Real-time DICOM Extractor

The Real-time DICOM Extractor runs continuously to receive DICOM files, extract and store their metadata in real-time into a Metadata Store, and then delete the data nightly.


# Configuring Niffler Real-time DICOM Extractor

Niffler real-time extraction must be configured as a service for it to run continuously and resume automatically even when the server restarts. Unless you are the administrator who is configuring Niffler for the first time, skip this section.

Find the system.json file in the service folder and modify accordingly.

system.json entries are to be set *only once* for the Niffler deployment by the administrator. Once set, further extractions do not require a change.

* *DCM4CHEBin*: Set the correct location of the DCM4_CHE folder.

* *QueryAet*: Set the correct AET:PORT of the querying AET (i.e., this script). Typically same as the values you set for the storescp.

* *StorageFolder*: Create a folder where you like your DICOM files to be. Usually, this is an empty folder (since each extraction is unique). 

* *FilePath*: By default, "{00100020}/{0020000D}/{0020000E}/{00080018}.dcm". This indicates a hierarchical storage of patients/studies/series/instances.dcm. Leave this value as it is unless you want to change the hierarchy.


## Configure DICOM attributes to extract

The conf folder consists of several featureset.txt files. Each featureset has multiple attributes. Each featureset corresponds to a collection in the Metadata Store MongoDB database. Skip this step if you are satisfied with the default attributes provided in the conf folder to extract.

If you desire more DICOM attributes to an existing collection, add the attribute to an existing featureset.txt. Similarly, you may also remove existing attributes from the featureset files. 

If you prefer the additional attributes in a separate collection in the Mongo Metadata Store, create a new txt file with the preferred attributes in the conf folder.



# Monitoring Niffler Real-time DICOM Extractor


## Check the status of the mdextractor service.

```
$ sudo systemctl status mdextractor.service

● mdextractor.service - mdextractor service
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/mdextractor.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)

```

## Restart to confirm everything works as expected:

```
$ sudo systemctl reboot
```

## View the service logs:
```
$ sudo journalctl -u mdextractor.service -n 100
```
Defining the below aliases in ~/.bashrc will help with quickly executing and configuring Niffler.
```
alias md='sudo journalctl -u mdextractor.service -f'

alias mm='mongo -u researchpacsroot --authenticationDatabase admin -p'
```
## Troubleshooting 

Check and make sure Mongo Service is running. If not, start it.

Is the disk not full? Check whether the mdextractor service is running. If not, start it.

Is the disk full, and consequently Niffler is unable to receive new images? Stop the mdextractor service if it is running. Empty the storage folder and remove the pickle files. Then, start the mdextractor service again.
