This script:
    1 - starts dcm4che to receive images from remote PACS.
    2 - reads txt files containing feature list to identify research profiles consisting of the interesting attributes.
    3 - grabs one instance per series and extract the metadata for the identified attributes and store in MongoDB.
    4 - deletes the dicom images periodically once the metadata is extracted.
    5 - keeps track of the volume of the dcm storage folder
