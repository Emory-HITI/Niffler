# The Niffler On-Demand Retrospective DICOM Extractor

The retrospective DICOM Extractor retrieves DICOM images on-demand, based on a CSV file provided by the user. 
It facilitates simple execution of several DICOM pulls in a single step, with just a CSV file consisting of values for
DICOM keywords that are compatible with CFIND. Without Niffler, this required a series of manual C-FIND and C-MOVE queries
one for each specific query. Now, with a CSV file, 10,000s of queries can be run at once, thanks to Niffler.
Niffler is flexible and allows certain formatting and provides a CFIND-ONLY mode in addition to the data pull.

Below we discuss the steps to run Niffler on-demand DICOM extraction queries. 


# Configuring Niffler On-Demand Extractor

Unless you are the administrator who is configuring Niffler for the first time, skip this section and proceed to the section "Using Niffler".

Find the system.json file in the folder and modify accordingly.

system.json entries are to be set *only once* for the Niffler deployment by the administrator. Once set, further extractions do not require a change.

* *DCM4CHEBin*: Set the correct location of the DCM4_CHE folder.

* *SrcAet*: Set the correct AET@HOST:PORT of the source.

* *QueryAet*: Set the correct AET:PORT of the querying AET (i.e., this script). Typically same as the values you set for the storescp.

* *DestAet*:   Set the correct AET of the detination AET. Must match the AET of the storescp.

* *NightlyOnly*: This is set to _true_ by default. Setting it to _false_ will make Niffler on-demand extraction run at any time.

* *StartHour*: When a night-only mode is enabled, when should the extraction start. A rough 24 hour time (hours only), calculated by the hour. Not an exact time.

* *EndHour*: When should the extraction end, when the night-mode is enabled. By default, the start hour is 19 and end hour is 7.

* *NifflerID*: The ID of the current execution. Default is 1. You must increment the second execution to 2, so that the logs are properly stored in niffler1.log and niffler2.log.

* *MaxNifflerProcesses*: How many Niffler processes can run in parallel. Make sure each execution has its own SrcAet properly configured. Each SrcAet can run only once.


# Using Niffler

## CSV file with correct format.

First, place the csv file adhering to the correct formats in a folder (by default, a folder named "csv" in the current folder).


* Please retrieve the CSV (not xlsx) file consisting of the images that must be acquired via Niffler.

* Each C-MOVE extraction should be represented by a separate line.

* Please make sure to use EMPI and not MRN or Institution-specific patient identifiers.

* Please include a header for the csv, such as "PatientID,AccessionNumber". The first line is considered the header and will be ignored in the extractions.

* Niffler can support up to 3 C-FIND DICOM keywords in queries. However, please note that the extractions are done internally in either patient level (if the query is just based on PatientID) or study level (for example, a combination of PatientID and AccessionNumber). So, if your matching 3 DICOM keyword extraction is aimed at receiving only particular series, Niffler will in fact retrieve the entire studies of the relevant series. Niffler's granularity for on-demand extraction does not go to series or instances level.

The format examples:
```
[1]
PatientID
AAAAA
AAAAA
AAAAA

[2]
PatientID,AccessionNumber
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB

* Make sure the accession's year is in the YY format while the *LongAccession* flag is set to *false* and the year can be in YYYY format while the *LongAccession* flag is set to *true*.

[3]
PatientID,AccessionNumber,StudyDate
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB,YYYYMMDD
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB,YYYYMMDD
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB,YYYYMMDD


[4]
PatientID,AccessionNumber,StudyMonth
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB,YYYYMM
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB,YYYYMM
AAAAA,BBBBBYYBBBBB,YYYYMM

``` 

## Configuring Extraction Profile with config.json.

Find the config.json file in the folder and modify accordingly.

config.json entries are to be set *for each* Niffler on-demand DICOM extractions.

All the following config entries can be passed as command line arguments. Prepend "--" to each key and pass as arguments in cli. By default, the values from `config.json` will be used. <br/>
Example: `python3 ./ColdDataRetriever.py --NumberOfQueryAttributes 1 --FirstAttr PatientID --FirstIndex 0`

* *NifflerSystem*: By default, system.json. Provide a custom json file with Niffler system information, if you have any.

* *StorageFolder*: Create a folder where you like your DICOM files to be. Usually, this is an empty folder (since each extraction is unique). Make sure you, i.e., the user that starts Niffler ColdDataRetriever.py, have write access to that folder.

* *FilePath*: By default, "{00100020}/{0020000D}/{0020000E}/{00080018}.dcm". This indicates a hierarchical storage of patients/studies/series/instances.dcm. Leave this value as it is unless you want to change the hierarchy.

* *CsvFile*: Enter the correct csv file name with a relative path to the current folder or a full path. The default value given assumes the CSV file to be in a "csv" folder in the current folder.

* *NumberOfQueryAttributes*: Can be 1, 2, or 3. By default, 1.

**Please note:** It is important to use the correct DICOM keywords such as, "PatientID", "AccessionNumber", "StudyInstanceUID", and "StudyDate".
  Please refer to the DICOM Standard for more information on the DICOM header attributes/keywords.
  Please note, the correct keyword is "AccessionNumber" and not "Accession" or "Accessions". Similarly, it is "PatientID" - neither "EMPI" nor "Patient-ID" (although they all are indeed the same in practice).
  Though "StudyMonth" is a non-DICOM attribute, the current version of Niffler supports "StudyMonth" attribute and works similar to "StudyDate" attribute.
  
Please refer to the DICOM standards to ensure you spell the [DICOM keyword](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part06/chapter_6.html) correctly, if in doubt.

* *FirstAttr*: Which should be the first attribute. By default, "PatientID".   
  
* *FirstIndex*: Set the CSV column index of first Attribute. By default, 0. Note the index starts at 0.

* *SecondAttr*: Which should be the second attribute. By default, "AccessionNumber". This field is ignored when NumberOfQueryAttributes is 1.

* *SecondIndex*: Set the CSV column index of second Attribute. By default, 1. This field is ignored when NumberOfQueryAttributes is 1.

* *ThirdAttr*: Which should be the third attribute. By default, "StudyDate". This field is ignored when NumberOfQueryAttributes is 1 or 2.

* *ThirdIndex*: Set the CSV column index of third Attribute. By default, 2. This field is ignored when NumberOfQueryAttributes is 1 or 2.

* *LongAccession*: Setting this parameter to true allows to handle long accession numbers of format YYYY. The default is false.

* *DateFormat*: DateFormat can range from %Y%m%d, %m/%d/%y, %m-%d-%y, %%m%d%y, etc. This field is ignored for extractions that do not use a Date as one of their extraction attributes. We have tested with StudyDate. Leave this entry unmodified for such cases. The default is %Y%m%d and works for most cases. When using StudyMonth attribute, the default is %Y-%m-%d.

* *SendEmail*: Do you want to send an email notification when the extraction completes? The default is true. You may disable this if you do not want to receive an email upon the completion.

* *YourEmail*: Replace "test@test.test" with a valid email if you would like to receive an email notification. If the SendEmail property is disabled, you can leave this as is.

## Running the Niffler Retrospective Data Retriever

```bash

$ python3 ColdDataRetriever.py

# With Nohup
$ nohup python3 ColdDataRetriever.py > UNIQUE-OUTPUT-FILE-FOR-YOUR-EXTRACTION.out &

# With Command Line Arguments
$ nohup python3 ColdDataRetriever.py --SendEmail false --NumberOfQueryAttributes 1 --FirstAttr AccessionNumber --FirstIndex 0 --CsvFile "csv/accession.csv"> UNIQUE-OUTPUT-FILE-FOR-YOUR-EXTRACTION.out &
```
Check that the extraction is going smooth, by,
```
$ tail -f UNIQUE-OUTPUT-FILE-FOR-YOUR-EXTRACTION.out
```
You will see lots of logs.

Now, if you see no log lines, most likely case is, a failure due to an on-going previous extraction. Check the Niffler logs.
```
$ tail -f niffler1.log
```
Above log might be niffler2.log. The log file is niffler, appended by a number indicated in system.json as NifflerID, where the default value is 1.
```
INFO:root:Number of running niffler processes: 2 and storescp processes: 1

ERROR:root:[EXTRACTION FAILURE] 2020-09-21 17:42:24.760598: Previous extraction still running. As such, your extraction attempt was not suuccessful this time. Please wait until that completes and re-run your query.
```
Try again later. Once there is no other process, then you can run your own extraction process. 



## Check the Progress
 
After some time (may take a few hours to a few days, depending on the length of the CSV file), check whether the extraction is complete.
```
$ tail -f niffler.log

INFO:root:[EXTRACTION COMPLETE] 2020-09-21 17:42:38.465501: Niffler Extraction to /opt/data/new-study Completes. Terminating the completed storescp process.
```
Apart from the original CSV file, a modified version of the CSV file is created depending on the attributes and a pickle file tracks the progress. The pickle file is created by appending ".pickle" to the modified csv file name in the same directory as the csv file. A sample pickle line is as below:

```
<8c>^X1234, 000056789<94>
```
For example, for extractions with 2 attributes, PatientID and AccessionNumber, each entry above is _PatientID,AccessionNumber_. For extractions with just PatientID, each entry above is _PatientID_.

For other combinations of extractions, each entry above will be _PatientID,StudyInstanceUID_. The reason is Niffler internally _translates_ these headers into C-MOVE extractions with PatientID and StudyInstanceUID.


## Pause-and-resume vs. Rerun from the scratch

As elaborated above, a pickle file tracks the progress of the extraction. This file is created by appending ".pickle" to the csv file (which is indicated by "CsvFile" in the config.json) in the same folder. When you have to stop the extraction in the middle or when the extraction stops involuntarily due to other factors (such as server power failure), you could re-run the ColdDataRetriever.py as is. Then ColdDataRetriever.py retrieves the studies that are not retrieved yet.

On the other hand, if you want to run a fresh extraction from scratch - one where the output is sent to another folder, expecting it to get all the studies rather than those that were not extracted in the previous run, please make sure to delete the .pickle file first. Otherwise, when you re-run an extraction with a previously completed CSV file, Niffler finds the pickle file. The pickle file consists of almost all (almost, because the pickle is updated periodically rather than per each C-MOVE run) the completed lines from the CSV. When Niffler encounters this, Niffler will only extract the few studies that were not listed in the pickle.

So in summary:

1) Re-run as-is, with the presence of the pickle file, if your intention is to resume an extraction that was running but incomplete (i.e., the classic pause-and-resume mode).

2) Run after deleting the respective pickle file, if your intention is to run from the scratch, with the outputs sent to a fresh/new directory rather than a pause-and-resume.

## CFIND-ONLY and CFIND-DETAILED modes

Niffler also supports a CFIND-ONLY mode.

To activate, use the below value,
```
	"FilePath": "CFIND-ONLY",
```

The output is cfind-output.csv in the StorageFolder, consisting of PatientID, StudyInstanceUID, AccessionNumber, and StudyDescription. This is a quick process as it just retrieves the metadata through C-FIND rather than the entire DICOM images through a C-MOVE.

CFIND-DETAILED mode provides a more elaborate C-FIND output with more DICOM keywords (defined in description.csv.xsl).

To activate, use the below value,
```
	"FilePath": "CFIND-DETAILED",
```

# Setting up an Orthanc Server

[Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com/) is an Open-source, lightweight and standalone DICOM Server which enables to convert any machine into a DICOM store (in other words, a mini-PACS system). The Orthanc Framework is supported by all major Operating Systems including Windows, Linux and MacOS.

1. Downloading Orthanc
- **Windows**: https://www.orthanc-server.com/download.php
- **Linux**: sudo apt-get install orthanc
- **MacOS**: https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=download-mac

2. Locating Configuration file
- Windows 
  - Go to "Orthanc Server" folder that was downloaded
  - Configuration file in named as *Orthanc* in this folder
- Linux and MacOS
  - Enter the following command: ```Orthanc --config=Configuration.json ```
  - Configuration file will be saved with the name *Configuration.json* in the present working directory.

The following steps do not depend on the underlying Operating System.

3. Modify the Configuration file
- The values of DICOMModalities ("sample" : [ "STORESCP", "127.0.0.1", 2000 ]) should be changed to [AET, IP Address, Port Number]
  - **AET**: AET is the same as "QueryAET" from system.json in the cold extraction module
  - **IP Address**: IP Address of the server in which Niffler is running. If Orthanc is being hosted on the local machine, this value can be set to - 127.0.0.1
  - **Port Number**: Enter any port number (usually 4 digits).
- The values of RemoteAccessAllowed is to be set to *true*.

4. Uploading DICOM Files
- Open the Orthanc Server at 127.0.0.1:8042 (if the server is hosted on a server, use the ip address of server instead of 127.0.0.1) in a web browser.
- Upload the DICOM files. The uploaded files could be verified at *All Studies*.

5. Modify the system.json
- **SrcAET**: "ORTHANC@IPAddress:4242" (IP Address of the hosting system, 127.0.0.1 if the server is being hosted locally)
- **QueryAET**: "AET:8080" (AET from point-3. In this case - "niffler")
- **DestAET**: "AET" (In this case - "niffler")

6. Run and test the server
- Running the Configuration file through ```./Orthanc Configuration.json``` command will start the Orthanc Server.
- Modify the config.json as per the above instructions. Create a csv file with the information to be used for extraction and run the cold extraction module in Niffler to test the Orthanc Server.
  
# Troubleshooting

If the process fails even when no one else's Niffler process is running, check your log file (UNIQUE-OUTPUT-FILE-FOR-YOUR-EXTRACTION.out)

If you find an error such as: "IndexError: list index out of range", that indicates your csv file and/or config.json are not correctly set.

Fix them and restart your Python process, by first finding and killing your python process and then starting Niffler as before.
```
$ sudo ps -xa | grep python

1866 ?    Ss   0:00 /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/networkd-dispatcher --run-startup-triggers

1936 ?    Ssl  0:00 /usr/bin/python3 /usr/share/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrade-shutdown --wait-for-signal

2926 pts/0  T   0:00 python3 ColdDataRetriever.py

3384 pts/0  S+   0:00 grep --color=auto python

$ sudo kill 2926
```
You might need to run the above command with sudo to find others' Niffler processes.

Make sure not to kill others' Niffler processes. So double-check and confirm that the running process is indeed the one that was started by you, and yet failed.


Rarely, a storescp process started by another user becomes a zombie and prevents Niffler from starting. If that happens, check for storescp processes and kill them as well. Please make sure you are killing only the on-demand Niffler storescp process. By default, this will be shown QBNIFFLER:4243 as below.
```
$ sudo ps -xa | grep storescp

241720 pts/4  Sl   0:02 java -cp /opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/etc/storescp/:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/etc/certs/:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/lib/dcm4che-tool-storescp-5.22.5.jar:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/lib/dcm4che-core-5.22.5.jar:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/lib/dcm4che-net-5.22.5.jar:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/lib/dcm4che-tool-common-5.22.5.jar:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/lib/slf4j-api-1.7.30.jar:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.30.jar:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/lib/log4j-1.2.17.jar:/opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/lib/commons-cli-1.4.jar org.dcm4che3.tool.storescp.StoreSCP --accept-unknown --directory /home/Data/Mammo/Kheiron/cohort_1/ --filepath {00100020}/{0020000D}/{0020000E}/{00080018}.dcm -b QBNIFFLER:4243 242185 pts/5  S+   0:00 grep --color=auto storescp

$ sudo kill 241720
```
## Testing your deployment with Niffler C-ECHO Implementation

Sometimes your connection may not succeed due to firewall issues or because the source PACS not recognizing your end as a valid AET. To confirm and rule out these issues, you can issue a C-ECHO command included with Niffler. 

**First, please make sure your system.json is updated with the correct values for "SrcAet" and "QueryAet"**.

Then, run the below.

````
$ python3 TestConnection.py
````

The below output indicates the success.
````
C-ECHO request status: 0x0000
````

If you receive any other output such as the below, that indicates the connection was not successful. 
````
Association rejected, aborted or never connected
````

Please check again the "SrcAet" and "QueryAet" in system.json for correctness. 

If everything is correct in your/Niffler end, please consult your enterprise PACS deployment for configuration. Is it configured correctly to accept queries from your "QueryAet"? Is there a firewall? Is that firewall configured to accept queries **from** your QueryAet (host and port)?


## Testing your deployment with DCM4CHE

Niffler strives to be stable for at least the latest stable releases. But since it is still an open-source research project by a university research group, it may have bugs at times - which we aim to fix as soon as we spot. But if your extraction fails for some reason, you could rule out whether the issue is really a Niffler bug or whether some other issue such as some problems in the PACS connection. 

Simply start a storescp and movescu clients (in that order) of DCM4CHE from the server where you are attempting to run Niffler. If the below commands work, but Niffler still fails (after correctly following the README), it could indicate a Niffler bug.

The requests take the below format.

```
C-STORE

DCM4CHE_BIN/storescp --accept-unknown --directory storage-folder --filepath "{00100020}/{0020000D}/{0020000E}/{00080018}.dcm" -b QUERY_AET > storescp.out &
```

The files will be stored in a directory _storage-folder_

```
C-MOVE

DCM4CHE_BIN/movescu -c SRC_AET -b QUERY_AET -M PatientRoot -m PatientID=EMPI --dest DEST_AET
```

Replacing with sample values,

```
C-STORE

nohup /opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/bin/storescp --accept-unknown --directory new-pydicom --filepath "{00100020}/{0020000D}/{0020000E}/{00080018}.dcm" -b "QBNIFFLER:4243" > storescp.out &


C-MOVE
nohup /opt/dcm4che-5.22.5/bin/movescu -c "AE_ARCH2@xx.yy.ww.zz:104" -b "QBNIFFLER:4243" -M PatientRoot -m PatientID=12345678 --dest QBNIFFLER > movescu.out &
```

If the testing with DCM4CHE as above does not work, that is an issue likely with your PACS configuration to send DICOM data to your endpoint. Please get the above to work first in that case before attempting the execution with Niffler.
